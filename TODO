GENERAL:
- Add LICENSE
- Turn on strict flags in tsconfig

IVY:
- Why is RElement not assignable to Element and vice versa?
- Renderer3Factory etc. needs deep imports
- Maybe Ivy instructions can be instructed not to append child if it found
   that the node returned from the renderer is rehydrated.
- Need to support projection when using components or elements. Need hook from
  Ivy on `elementEnd`.
- Need to support <ng-container>. It is similar to templates created for *ngIf,
  *ngFor but the content is immediately evaluated instead of at the end of the
  current view creation. We need some way in Ivy to differentiate between a
  ng-container and other kinds of embedded templates - Maybe usign a different
  comment data.
- Language Service is borked with Ivy directive references (Can't recognize
  *ngIf and *ngFor).

ANGULAR ELEMENTS:
- Change Ivy Element Strategy to restore properties and render with a single
  renderComponent so that rehydration is possible.
- Let the IvyStrategy take in optional Renderer3Factory as a parameter so that
  it can be reused on the server.
- Angular Elements pulls in ComponentNgElementStrategyFactory by default. Should
  not be needed for Ivy elements and save some bytes. Currently Angular Elements
  is 20 KB. Could be smaller.
- Need a way to statically check lazy Elements usage(currently turned off) - 
  whether the custom element name and properties are valid.
- Difference from Angular Elements - Reflect attribute to property only for
  initial attributes(just to keep things simple). Attributes on Elements exist
  only as a mechanism to transfer state from server to client.
- Using ComponentFactoryResolver in getComponentInputs pulls in a lot/whole of
  @angular/core.
- Why is the observedAttribute based on internal template name?
